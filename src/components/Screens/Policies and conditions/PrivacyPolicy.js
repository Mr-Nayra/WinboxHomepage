              The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of

                Users have given their consent for one or more specific

                to process Personal Data until the User objects to such
                processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any
                other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not
                apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to
                European data protection law;

              contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
              a contract.

              Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
